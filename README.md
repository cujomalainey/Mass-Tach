# Mass-Tach
Massive Wireless Tachometer System

Goal:
Build a completely wireless system which can track distance of station bikes of many types that can run for 48 hours straight minimum.

Proposed method:
Use Garmin cadence sensos count cycles which transmit via ANT to the arduinos, transmit via xbee to raspberry pi then push to database in the cloud. From that database use website technologies to push/get that data to apps and webpages in real-time.

Proposed completion date: 
September 2016
